## Description

This mini-course teaches the five **SOLID** object-oriented design principles through practical Python examples, real-world refactorings, and progressively challenging assignments.

Perfect for developers who want to:
- Stop writing fragile spaghetti code
- Make their codebases easy to extend, test, and maintain

By the end you’ll be able to spot SOLID violations instantly and refactor them with confidence.

## Concepts & Notebooks

**Module 1: (SRP) Single Responsibility Principle** - [SRP.ipynb](SRP.ipynb)
> "A class should have one, and only one, reason to change."

**Module 2: (OCP) Open/Closed Principle** - [OCP.ipynb](OCP.ipynb)
> "Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification."  

**Module 3: (LSP) Liskov Substitution Principle** - [LSP.ipynb](LSP.ipynb)
> "Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without breaking the program breaking."    

**Module 4: (ISP) Interface Segregation Principle**  
> "Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use." 

**Module 5: (DIP) Dependency Inversion Principle**  
> "Depend on abstractions, not on concretions."  

All principles applied together in a complete mini e-commerce example → [example.ipynb](example.ipynb)
