# Mastering Clean, Maintainable Code with SOLID Principles

**A Practical Python Edition**  

## Description

SOLID is the most impactful set of object-oriented design principles that separate junior code from senior, maintainable codebases. Mastering SOLID will make your code easier to read, test, extend, and refactor. 

## Concepts & Notebooks

**Module 1: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** - `SRP.ipynb`
> "A class should have one, and only one, reason to change."

**Module 2: Open/Closed Principle (OCP)** - `OCP.ipynb`
> "Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification."  

**Module 3: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)** - `LSP.ipynb`
> "Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without breaking the program breaking."    

**Module 4: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**  
> "Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use." 

**Module 5: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**  
> "Depend on abstractions, not on concretions." 
- ALL modules implemented in `example.ipynb`
